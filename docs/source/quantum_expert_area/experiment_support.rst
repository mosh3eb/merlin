==================
Experiment Support
==================

Photonic experiments in `Perceval <https://perceval.quandela.net/>`_ bundle the elements of an optical circuit and its post-processing rules. MerLin uses this abstraction:
passing a :class:`perceval.Experiment` to :class:`~merlin.algorithms.layer.QuantumLayer` or to :class:`~merlin.algorithms.kernels.FeatureMap` lets you specify how each optical mode should be measured.

Both of the features presented below cannot be used if combined with ``MeasurementStrategy.AMPLITUDES`` because adding photon loss or detectors corresponds to performing a measurement of the quantum state. 
This collapses the quantum state and is therefore incompatible with amplitude retrieval.

Noisy Simulations
=================

Perceval’s `NoiseModel <https://perceval.quandela.net/docs/v1.0/reference/utils/noise_model.html>`_ stores photon-loss parameters that
MerLin reads automatically. Assign it to the ``experiment.noise`` attribute with 
*brightness* and *transmittance*. The quantum layer combines
them into a survival probability and inserts a
:class:`~merlin.measurement.photon_loss.PhotonLossTransform`. As a result, ``output_keys`` include configurations where
photons disappear before detection and probability mass still sums to one.

For now, MerLin supports a global photon survival probability which applies to every mode. It is calculated as such:

.. math::

   survival\_probability = brightness \times transmittance

Usage
--------

.. code-block:: python

    import perceval as pcvl
    import torch
    import merlin as ML

    circuit = pcvl.Circuit(3)
    circuit.add(0, pcvl.PS(pcvl.P("px")))
    circuit.add((0, 1), pcvl.BS())
    circuit.add((1, 2), pcvl.BS())

    experiment = pcvl.Experiment(circuit)
    # Model 10% loss from the source (brightness) and 15% from propagation loss (transmittance)
    experiment.noise = pcvl.NoiseModel(brightness=0.9, transmittance=0.85)

    # Noisy quantum layer
    layer = ML.QuantumLayer(
        input_size=1,
        experiment=experiment,
        input_parameters=["px"],
        input_state=[1, 1, 1],
    )

    x = torch.rand(3, 1)  # Generated data
    probs = layer(x)
    states = layer.output_keys  # includes both photon survival and photon loss outcomes

The default value for brightness and transmittance during noise model initialization is 1.0.

Detector Support
================

Perceval's `Dectectors <https://perceval.quandela.net/docs/v1.0/reference/components/detector.html>`_ are used to detect the number of photons on each mode. Indeed, every detector detects for one mode. Perceval exposes several detector families:

``pcvl.Detector.pnr()``
    Ideal photon-number-resolving detector. This detector detects any number of photons present. Leaves the Fock basis unchanged.

``pcvl.Detector.threshold()``
    Binary detector that only distinguishes between “zero” and “non-zero”
    photons on a mode.

``pcvl.Detector.ppnr(n_wires, max_detections=None)``
    Partially projected detector that groups several optical modes (``n_wires``)
    into a logical output with optional truncation through ``max_detections``. This detector can detect up to ``max_detections`` photons and ``max_detections`` is bounded above by ``n_wires``.

Detectors can return multiple classical outcomes for a single quantum state. The
layer converts the raw Fock probabilities into detector keys through
:class:`~merlin.measurement.detectors.DetectorTransform`, so probabilities
remain properly normalised regardless of the detection model. Finally, this detector transform is applied after the photon loss transform so they can both be used simultaneously without problem.

On a sidenote, detectors will be ignored if ``ComputationSpace`` is not ``FOCK`` because using a different computation space already translates to using special detectors.
